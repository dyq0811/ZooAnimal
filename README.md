# ZooAnimal
A program that reads from a text file with one line for each animal in a zoo.


It represents each animal as an instance of a class ZooAnimal and converts the text file data into a List<ZooAnimal>, sort the list, and print the list with the animals sorted alphabetically in one of two forms: as a display of animal images or as a text list.


The program is a good practice working with the List ADT, String, File, Scanner, loops, and simple classes. It also shows how java can display images, moving closer to more complicated applications.
